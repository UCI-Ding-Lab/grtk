class SelectFromCollection:
    """
    Select indices from a matplotlib collection using `LassoSelector`.

    Selected indices are saved in the `ind` attribute. This tool fades out the
    points that are not part of the selection (i.e., reduces their alpha
    values). If your collection has alpha < 1, this tool will permanently
    alter the alpha values.

    Note that this tool selects collection objects based on their *origins*
    (i.e., `offsets`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    ax : `~matplotlib.axes.Axes`
        Axes to interact with.
    collection : `matplotlib.collections.Collection` subclass
        Collection you want to select from.
    alpha_other : 0 <= float <= 1
        To highlight a selection, this tool sets all selected points to an
        alpha value of 1 and non-selected points to *alpha_other*.
